![Karumi logo][karumilogo] KataSuperHeroes for Android. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miguelamartin/KataSuperHeroesAndroid.svg?branch=kata-super-heroes)](https://travis-ci.org/miguelamartin/KataSuperHeroesAndroid)
============================

- We are here to practice UI Testing.
- We are going to use [Espresso][espresso] to interact with the Application UI.
- We are going to use [Dagger2][dagger2] to replace production code with [Test Doubles][testDoubles].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

---

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show Super Heroes information:

![ApplicationScreencast][applicationScreencast]

This Application is based on two Activities:

* ``MainActivity`` showing a list of super heroes with name, photo and a special badge if is part of the Avengers Team.

![MainActivityScreenhot][mainActivityScreenshot]

* ``SuperHeroDetailActivity`` showing detailed information for a super hero like the name, photo and description.

![SuperHeroDetailActivityScreenshot][superHeroDetailActivityScreenshot]


The application architecture, dependencies and configuration is ready to just start writing tests. In this project you'll find  ``Dagger2`` configured to be able to replace production code with test doubles easily and Espresso to be able to interact with the application user interface.


## Tasks

Your task as Android Developer is to **write all the UI tests** needed to check if the Application UI is working as it should. 

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**


Our recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository.
    2. Checkout `kata-super-heroes` branch.
    3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.
    4. Execute `MainActivityTest` and watch the only test it contains pass.

  * To help you get started, these are some test cases for `MainActivity`:     
    1. Setup mocked `SuperHeroesRepository` in `MainActivityTest` to return a list of some Super Heroes.
    2. Test that RecyclerView is listing the correct number of elements when `SuperHeroesRepository` returns a list of some Super Heroes.
    3. Test that each of this elements contains the correct Super Hero name.

## Considerations

* If you get stuck, `Master` branch contains already solved tests for `MainActivity` and `SuperHeroDetailActivity`

* A [DaggerMockRule][daggermock] is an utility to let you create [Dagger 2][dagger2] modules dynamically. In this case we are using it to create a new `MainModule` in this testing scope. Instead of returning real objects, this new `MainModule` will returns the mock for `SuperHeroesRepository` defined in this test.

* You will find some utilities to help you test RecyclerViews and Toolbars easily in:
  ``app/src/androidTest/java/com/karumi/katasuperheroes/matchers`` and ``app/src/androidTest/java/com/karumi/katasuperheroes/recyclerview``.

  * `RecyclerViewInteraction`: provides an easy way to apply an Espresso matcher to all of the RecyclerView elements

	```java
	
	RecyclerViewInteraction.onRecyclerView(withId(R.id.recycler_view))
	.withItems(A_LIST_OF_ITEMS)
	.check(new RecyclerViewInteraction.ItemViewAssertion() {
	    @Override
	    public void check(SuperHero item, View view, NoMatchingViewException e) {
	        matches(A_MATCHER).check(view, e);
	    }
	});
	```
  * `RecyclerViewItemsCountMatcher`: a matcher that returns true if RecyclerView contains the expected number of elements.

  * `ToolbarMatcher`: a matcher that returns true if a Toolbar with expected title is found.
  
## Extra Tasks

If you've covered all the application functionality using UI tests try to continue with the following tasks:

* Add a pull to refresh mechanism to ``MainActivity`` and test it.
* Modify ``SuperHeroDetailActivity`` to handle an error case where the name of the super hero used to start this activity does not exist and show a message if this happens.
* Modify the project to handle connection errors and show a ``SnackBar`` to indicate something went wrong.
* Modify ``SuperHeroesRepository`` test double to perform a ``Thread.sleep`` and use the custom idling resources you'll find in this repository to get your tests working.
